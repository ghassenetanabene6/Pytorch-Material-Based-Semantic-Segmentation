HRIM2021 is the last version of our custom dataset used to train and improve the final results.

It is composed of 15315 images from : 

- The first "HRIM2021-Dataset-279-images" that are augmented (x27) in this large dataset.
- Other images obtained after doing web scraping from the official website of "opensurfaces" and automatically annotated with the file : "utils/synthetic_mask.py".
- Images selected from the MINC segmentation dataset. 


The SegmentationClass Folder contains the annotations. 
The JPEGImages contains the original images that are not all annotated.

Please verify that the images sets for training and validation are annotated before to avoid any existence error.
